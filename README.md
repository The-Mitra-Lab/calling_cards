# Prerequisites

The scripts in this folder require `python3`, preferrably a relatively recent version (e.g. â‰¥ 3.5). In addition, you will need to install the following modules:
- `pysam`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `twobitreader`

The easiest way to install them is:
- If `python3` is the default:
`pip install pysam numpy pandas twobitreader`
- Otherwise:
`pip3 install pysam numpy pandas twobitreader`

To figure out which version of `python` is installed by default:
- `python -V`
